Column Renaming: The script now renames all five columns, keeping the first two columns (Index and Keyword) as they are, and renaming the rest to Search Term, Longest Option, and Shortest Option.

Search Term Identification: The script correctly identifies the column containing the actual search terms and processes them with Selenium.

Data Saving: After processing, the script saves the updated data back into the original Excel file under the correct sheet.
